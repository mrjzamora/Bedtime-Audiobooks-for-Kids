Lio and the Potty Adventure

By Mr. AiLio and Daddy


In the lush and vibrant jungle, Lio the little lion was ready for a big step. Lio, who was half Colombian and half Dominican, loved playing soccer, beating drums, and enjoying pizza with his family. But today, he had an important mission: it was time to use the potty like a big lion.

One sunny morning, Lio woke up with determination in his heart. He ran to the kitchen, where Mommy Lion was preparing breakfast. "Good morning, Mommy!" Lio said with a brave smile.

"Good morning, Lio! Are you ready for your big day?" Mommy Lion asked, her eyes twinkling with pride.

"Yes, Mommy! I want to use the potty like a big lion," Lio announced.

Mommy Lion nodded and showed Lio a special potty chart covered with bright, colorful stickers. "Every time you use the potty, you can choose a sticker to put on your chart. When you fill it up, we'll have a big pizza party to celebrate!"

Lio's eyes lit up. He loved stickers and pizza! "Okay, Mommy! I'm ready!"

The first try wasn't easy. Lio ran to the potty, but nothing happened. He frowned in frustration. "It's not working, Mommy!"

Mommy Lion knelt beside him and said, "It's okay, Lio. Sometimes it takes time. Just be patient and try again later."

Throughout the day, Lio had a few funny mishaps. He rushed to the potty but missed it by a few seconds. Another time, he sat on the potty but got distracted by a butterfly and forgot why he was there.

Mommy Lion was always there with encouraging words. "You're doing great, Lio! Just keep trying."

Finally, in the late afternoon, Lio felt it. He hurried to the potty and, with determination, he succeeded! He looked up at Mommy Lion with wide eyes. "I did it, Mommy! I used the potty!"

Mommy Lion cheered and hugged him tightly. "I'm so proud of you, Lio! Let's put a special sticker on your chart."

Lio carefully chose a shiny gold star and placed it on his potty chart. He beamed with pride. "Look, Mommy! I did it!"

That evening, the whole family gathered for a celebration. Daddy Lion came home with a big pizza, and they all cheered for Lio's success. As they enjoyed their delicious pizza, Lio felt a sense of accomplishment.

From that day on, Lio became more confident with using the potty. He learned that with patience and perseverance, he could achieve anything. And every time he looked at his potty chart filled with stickers, he remembered his exciting adventure and the love and support of his family.

And so, Lio's potty adventure became a cherished memory, one of many in the colorful life of a little lion growing up in the jungle.

The end.
